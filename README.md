# Retail_Sales_Database
The purpose of this practical is to upload and retrieve data into SQL and make findings. We analyse retail Sales data to verify which products are in demand , costs and total revenue. We use SQL basics such as Aggregates such as MAX,MIN,AVG and others if and else statements to make logical decision and understanding default statements.
